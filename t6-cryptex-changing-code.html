    <p>
        To change the code, first unlock the cryptex. Pop out the two pins in the end of the left half of the cryptex.
        Pull out the rings, making sure to keep track of the extra pins in the leftmost part of the cryptex.
        To change a digit, pop out the inner ring, rotate the two rings such that the hole in the inner matches up with the desired digit on the outer.
        Each ring has a flare inwards at the bottom; make sure they are facing away from each other.
        Slide the rings back on, and then add the retainer ring (the one with the pin holes).
        Pin the ring back in. Make sure the pin doesn't protude into the center, and that each pin is in both sides.
        Relock the cryptex with the new code.

    <p><b>Write the code down somewhere!</b> There is nothing you can do to reopen it intact if you forget the code!</p>
